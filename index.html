      <h1>Greatest of all time</h1>

        <p>
          Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro born 5 February 1985) is a
          Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier
          League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team.
          Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo
          has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden
          Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his
          career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues,
          and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for most
          appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions
          League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals
          (117), and international appearances by a European (191). He is one of
          the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career
          appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for
          club and country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with
          Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first
          season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League
          titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23,
          he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most
          expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid
          in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15
          trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, and four
          Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He
          won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and
          2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived
          career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an
          initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an
          Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A
          titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and a Coppa Italia, before returning
          to Manchester United in 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age
          of 18 and has since earned over 190 caps, making him Portugal's
          most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level,
          he is also the nation's all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in
          and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international
          goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He
          assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo
          was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese
          Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their
          first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver
          Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led
          them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and
          later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was
          ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and
          the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time
          included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the
          world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to
          earn US$1 billion in his career.
